# eforms_NLA

## Description
This project contains R Shiny code for parsing JSON files from the NCCA 2020 mobile app, which will allows app users to format and keep an initial copy of their data for examination. It requires users to save all of the files from a site visit in a single folder and produces an Excel file with worksheets for each data type or a set of comma-delimited (.csv) files in a .zip file.
